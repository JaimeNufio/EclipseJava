PP 2.8 Write a program that reads values representing the weight in
kilograms, grams, and milligrams and then prints the equivalent
weight in milligrams. (For example, 1 kilogram, 50 grams, and
42 milligrams is equivalent to 10,50,042 milligrams.)

PP 2.9 Create a version of the previous project that reverses the computation.
That is, read a value representing the weight in milligrams,
then print the equivalent weight as a combination of
kilograms, grams, and milligrams. (For example, 90,70,056
milligrams is equivalent to 9 kilograms, 70 grams, and
56 milligrams.)
